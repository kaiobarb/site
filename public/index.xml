      <description>Hey We are now one week into 2021. Among all the festivities, celebrations, and general newness in my life, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded to take some time to write down my intentions.
This follows what has been a notable year to most, including myself.
In Retrospect Looking back, 2020 did not live up to my expectations (no great surprise there,) though it was not all bad. I would qualify this past year as passive, if I were to choose a single word for it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a hobbyist programmer with an interest in game development and good software. I look for beauty in art, life, and purpose. Sometimes I make things&amp;ndash;most of the time I don&amp;rsquo;t, but when I do you&amp;rsquo;ll see them here on this site.</description>
